## üì± Overview

Telegram AI Assistant is a powerful tool for productive work with Telegram chats. It uses artificial intelligence to analyze messages, track tasks, questions, and important information, ensuring nothing important is missed in the flow of messages.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Passive chat monitoring** - reads messages in all or selected chats without sending messages on your behalf
- **AI content analysis** - uses OpenAI o3-mini to understand the context of messages, images, and links
- **Task management** - automatically detects tasks in messages and creates them in Linear
- **Question tracking** - identifies questions directed at you and reminds you of unanswered ones
- **Automatic summaries** - generates brief reports on discussions in chats
- **Activity analytics** - tracks team engagement and activity
- **Two-component architecture**:
  - Userbot (user client) for reading messages from your account
  - Bot for interacting with you and displaying results

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

![Architecture](https://i.imgur.com/jUw5XTl.png)

The system consists of several components:

3. **Linear integration** - manages tasks in the Linear tracker
4. **Telegram Bot** - provides an interface for interacting with the system
5. **Database** - stores messages, tasks, and other data

- `created_at` - When user was added to DB

### 2. Messages

## üìù Message Classification

The AI analyzes each message and classifies it into different categories:

### Message Categories
- **Question** - Message contains a question directed at someone
- **Task** - Message describes work that needs to be done
- **Status Update** - Message provides update on ongoing work
- **General Discussion** - Regular conversation
- **Error** - Message couldn't be properly analyzed

### Message Intent Analysis
The system scores messages on three dimensions:
1. **Task Creation Request** (1-10) - How clearly it asks to create a task
2. **Task Candidate** (1-10) - How suitable it is to become a task
3. **Database Query** (1-10) - How likely it needs database information

### Important Flags
- **is_important** - Messages requiring prompt attention
- **is_question** - Messages containing questions
- **has_task** - Messages describing tasks

### Question Reminder Conditions
Reminders are only sent when:
- The admin is directly tagged/mentioned in a message
- Someone replies to the admin's message
- Channel messages and comments on channel posts are filtered out

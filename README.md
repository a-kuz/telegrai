## üì± Overview

Telegram AI Assistant is a powerful tool for productive work with Telegram chats. It uses artificial intelligence to analyze messages, track tasks, questions, and important information, ensuring nothing important is missed in the flow of messages.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Passive chat monitoring** - reads messages in all or selected chats without sending messages on your behalf
- **AI content analysis** - uses OpenAI GPT-4o to understand the context of messages, images, and links
- **Task management** - automatically detects tasks in messages and creates them in Linear
- **Question tracking** - identifies questions directed at you and reminds you of unanswered ones
- **Automatic summaries** - generates brief reports on discussions in chats
- **Activity analytics** - tracks team engagement and activity
- **Two-component architecture**:
  - Userbot (user client) for reading messages from your account
  - Bot for interacting with you and displaying results
